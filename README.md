# 🧠 Deep Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Radiotherapy Beam Orientation

This repository contains the code and experiments for my work on **patient-specific Beam Orientation Optimization (BOO)** in head-and-neck radiotherapy using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**. The agent learns to select clinically meaningful gantry angles directly from voxel-level anatomy, **without** repeated Monte Carlo dose simulations.

> **TL;DR:** Given CT + anatomical masks, this system proposes 5 optimal beam angles in **<1 second** inference per patient after training, improving PTV coverage vs. equiangular baselines.

## 📌 Overview / Problem

Selecting clinically optimal beam orientations is crucial in radiotherapy.  
Conventional BOO methods:

- ❌ Not personalized to anatomy
- ❌ Computationally infeasible at large search spaces
- ❌ Insensitive to voxel-level geometry
- ❌ Require repeated full dose simulations

---

## 🚀 Core Idea

We formulate BOO as a **sequential decision-making problem** and train a Deep Q-Network to:

- Extract **voxel-level anatomical structure** from CT + organ masks
- Sequentially choose **5 distinct beam angles**
- Accumulate a **pseudo-physical dose surrogate** over timesteps
- Optimize reward balancing:
  - **PTV coverage** (good)
  - **OAR sparing** (avoid toxicity)

Inference time: **<1 second** per patient.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishdef7/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Personalized-Radiotherapy-Beam-Orientation-Optimization.git
cd Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Personalized-Radiotherapy-Beam-Orientation-Optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📂 Dataset (OpenKBP)

We use the OpenKBP dataset (head-and-neck):

- CT volumes  
- PTV mask  
- OAR masks (cord, brainstem, L/R parotids, mandible)

Split:

- Train: **200**
- Validation: **40**
- Test: **100**

🛠 Users must download OpenKBP separately and update paths in `configs/experiments.json`


---

## ▶️ Running Evaluation (Generate Results + Figures)

```bash
python eval_main.py
```

Outputs will include:

- `results/test_results.csv` — per-patient metrics (D95, coverage, OAR doses)
- `figures/patient_XXX_dose_dqn.png` — DQN dose maps overlaid on CT
- `figures/patient_XXX_dvh_dqn.png` — dose–volume histogram plots


---

## 🏋️ Training from Scratch

```bash
python train.py
```

Training summary:

- Replay buffer: 3000
- Batch size: 32
- γ = 0.95
- ε-greedy: 0.90 → 0.10
- Target network update every 5 epochs
- Converges in ~3.5 hours CPU

## 📈 Results — 100 Patient Evaluation

| Method        | Coverage  | D95     |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **DQN (ours)** | **0.8059** | **0.2405** |
| Equiangular   | 0.6867    | 0.1207 |
| Heuristic     | 0.6397    | 0.0949 |
| RandomMean    | 0.5883    | 0.0554 |

### Key Highlights
- **+11.9% absolute improvement** in PTV coverage
- **~2× improvement** in D95
- **<1 second** per patient (post-training)
- Strong generalization across **100 unseen CT cases**

## 🧬 Model Summary

**State (8 channels):**
- CT
- PTV mask
- 5 OAR masks
- Accumulating dose surrogate

**Actions:**
- 36 discrete gantry angles (0–350° at 10° spacing)
- DQN selects **5 sequential non-repeating beams**

**Architecture:**
- 5× Conv layers + BN + ReLU
- Bottleneck: 4×4×256
- Fully connected head
- Masking to prevent repeated beams
- Model parameters: ~3.4M

**Dose Surrogate:**
1) Ray-traced geometric field  
2) Gaussian blur → approximate scatter  
3) Accumulate dose per timestep  

**Reward:**
- Terminal reward based on:
  - ↑ D95 and coverage
  - ↓ mean OAR dose

## 🎨 Qualitative Examples

Located in:

```
figures/success_cases/
figures/typical_cases/
figures/failure_cases/
figures/anomaly_cases/
```

High-dose regions remain **inside PTV** and spare critical OARs.  
DVH curves reflect improved target coverage.

## 📊 Baselines Implemented

All evaluated under **identical surrogate dose** to ensure fair comparison:

- **Equiangular beams**
- **Geometry heuristic**
- **Random non-repeating beams** (mean)


---

## 🧭 Clinical Interpretation

- Higher D95 → higher local tumor control likelihood
- OAR avoidance reduces severe toxicity risk
- <1s runtime enables:
  - Adaptive planning
  - Online replanning
  - QA workflow assistive tools


---

## 🚧 Limitations (Honest Assessment)

- Surrogate dose ≠ true Monte Carlo dose
- Current version operates on **single 2D slice**
- Trained only on **head-and-neck geometry**
- Research prototype — **not clinically deployable**


---

## 🔮 Future Directions

- 3D DQN / U-Net encoders
- GPU-based Monte Carlo integration
- Learned neural surrogate physics
- Multi-objective RL (Pareto optimal)
- Online robustness against anatomical changes
- Multi-disease training (lung, pelvis, liver)
